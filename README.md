#Fake Store App#

The Fake Store App is a frontend to the Fake Store API. (fakestoreapi.com) This front end uses React components and features
full CRUD functionality. That is, Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.

The fake store is a testing sort of application, so new products created with this app are not really added to the Fake Store database.
neither do updates or deletions persist. Nevertheless, the app makes calls to the API, receives and displays data from the API, and
gives the user feedback in real time. The app is fully functional with error handling, relevant, and descriptive error messages as
well as success toast-like messages.

React state and side effect hooks make the app fully responsive to user input and other actions. Bootstrap creates an attractive layout 
and familiar design complete with spinners and user-friendly messages displayed during network and or api delays. The Home page features
a Bootstrap carousel with AI generated store images and a whimsicle welcome message.

Enjoy exploring the Fake Store with this thoughtfully designed, fully functional API frontend!
